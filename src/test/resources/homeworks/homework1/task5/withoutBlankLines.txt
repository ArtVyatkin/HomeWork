 The most important source of information about IntelliJ IDEA is this online help.
 To access it from IntelliJ IDEA, do one of the following:
    From the main menu, select Help | Help.
    Press F1 on the keyboard.
    Click The Help icon in a dialog or a tool window.
If you do not have internet access to view the online help,
you can use the IntelliJ IDEA Help plugin, which serves the help pages via the built-in web server for offline use.
    note
    The offline help plugin is updated when a new major version is released.
    Changes that are added to online help during the release cycle may not be available in the offline help.
